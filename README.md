# Django-saving-app
created web version of my saving app


Started learning Django by converting my Saving App from my first project, first project is made by using TKinter in Python.

With this app you can add your saving goal that you want to reach. To make it easer for you to control your expenses you can add all of your outgoings, monthy obligations and even you can put some money into your piggybank with tracking history.
